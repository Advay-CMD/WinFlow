## 🤔 What is WinFlow?
WinFlow is a utility to replace old WIN32 applications fully in modern WINUI3 without injecting code in WIN32 applications. This is a project that aims to improve the user experience, interactions and updates system functionality.
<br>
It replaces all the legacy and the WIN32 applications to a neat and cleaner WINUI3.
<br>
My vision is to make Windows 11 more fluent, more intrusive, and have more information in a neat way unlike windows. I think this solution is not only for people like "power users", but for everyone who uses windows. I believe that Windows 11 should be smooth, easy to use, with having as much customizability as possible.
